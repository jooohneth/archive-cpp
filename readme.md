### Why would a web3 dev need c++???
  
Interesting question, anon. Well, while I'm picking it up mostly for college purposes, I've realized along the way, that my understanding of gas golfing in Solidity has improved, very nice to see the associations. And... learning Rust has been easier, since a lot of it is similar in a way. 

### Resourses:

While you're here, anon. If you wanna learn C++ the engaging way, here's a good resource for ya: [link](https://cppbyexample.com/).
 
### Execute:

I most probably left some Makefiles in the directories to run the code via the command below, because I hate typing g++ commands. If I didn't, then oh well, you're on your own... 

Compile: 
```
  make compile
```

Run:
```
  make run
```


If you are looking to run this stuff for whatever reason.
